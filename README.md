# AzurePowerShell

This is a collection of PowerShell scripts that I use for demos, and as a resource for the community. 

There is a select set of scripts created by me.  There is a much larger set of scripts available at the [Microsoft Azure Script Center](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/scripts/)(http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/scripts/)

You should also learn about the "[Azure Automation](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/automation/)"(http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/automation/) service which allows you to create Runbooks (collections of scripts) to manage your Azure resources.
